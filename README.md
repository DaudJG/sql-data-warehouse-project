# SQL Data Warehouse Project

This project demonstrates my ability to design, build, and document a complete data warehouse using SQL Server, based on the modern Medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers). It follows industry best practices in data engineering, data modeling, and ETL workflows.

### Key Features

- Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) pipeline from CRM & ERP source systems
- Medallion Architecture with Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold data layers
- Star Schema with Fact and Dimension Tables
- Data Quality Checks
- Clear naming conventions 
- Realistic datasets

### ðŸ“š Learning Context

## ðŸ“š Tutorial Reference

This project was inspired by and based on the following tutorial:

ðŸŽ“ [SQL Data Warehouse Project â€“ Data With Baraa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GVqKuTVANE&list=PLNcg_FV9n7qZ4Ym8ZriYT6WF8TaC2e_R7&index=1)

I followed the core structure and architecture taught in the tutorial but reproduced all implementation steps independently to solidify my hands-on SQL and data warehousing skills.
